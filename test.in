Write a Java class that implements a text message interface.  It should have box
where the user can enter text and do a send.  It should also have a scrolling
region that displays the user's messages right justified and the responses left
justified.  There should be a abstract method that is called with the user's
message. There should be a method that is called with the non-user text that inserts
that text into the output stream.  Input should be displayed in a yellow box that
occupies the right 2/3 of the scrolling region.  Output should be displayed
in a green box that occupes the full scrolling region.	The class
should be implemented using Java Swing.  The class should not use annonymous
classes, using nested classes instead.	The input field should accept multiple
lines of input.

getNeighbors() that returns a List<Node> of the node's neighbors.  Write a
Java method toposort(List<Node> nodes) that returns a List<Node> of the
nodes in topological order, i.e. does a topological sort.  Include any necessary
explicit imports in the Java result.

Given the name of the source file and the fully qualified name of a method, return
the name of the outer class and the name of inner classes and the name of the package.
The package can be empty or consist of multiple items.	The class name is in external
form, i.e., it uses dot to spearate inner classes, not dollar sign.  There can be multiple
nested inner classes.

Your job is to create a set of classes to support a computer-controllable model railroad.
The standard way of displaying a train layout is to display an abstraction of the actual
layout that has a one-to-one mapping with the acatul layout but may omit some details such
as curves.  For a complex layout there can be multiple abstract displays with connections
from one to another.

The layout consists of a set of points defining the layout and representing the location
of the tracks.	The points are connected to one another appropriately to represent the layout.
The track layout
is separated into separate blocks. Collisions between trains are prevented by only allowing
one train into a block at one time. Some of the points
represent sensors which can tell if the train is over that particular point.  Some of the
sensors are associated with signal which controls whether the train can move from the
current block to a particular subsequent block.  Signals can be red or green.
There is a point on the track representing
the gap between two blocks.  All points other than gap points are associated with a given
block.	The track only branches at switches.  Switches have an pivot point and two exit
points labeled N and R. At any time they are in a mode connecting the entry to N or the
entry to R.  They also have sensors associated with the N and R branches that
will be used to trigger the switch automatically to prevent derailings.  A point at a
dead end will only have one connected point.  A point at a switch will have 3 connected
points.  All other points will have two connected points.  All the points within a block
are connected.

Operations will eventually be needed to track a trains current forward location and
the blocks it is currently occupying based on the sensors.  One also will want to know
the next block the train will get to.  One needs to know whether it is safe for a train
to go from one block to another (the signal setting for each signal).
